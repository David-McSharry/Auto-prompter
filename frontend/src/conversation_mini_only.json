Any decrease in the need for police patrols in the late evening would not mean that there could be more intensive patrolling in the afternoon.\n1. The schools in Parktown have introduced a number of after-school programs that will be available to teenagers until 6 p. m. on weekday afternoons.\n2.

The schools in Parktown have introduced a number of after-school programs that will be available to teenagers until 6 p. m. on weekday afternoons.\n\nThis option is significant because if teenagers are engaged in after-school programs during the time when many crimes occur (3 p.m. to 6 p.m.), then the measures aimed at keeping them at home in the evenings may not effectively address the issue of serious crimes occurring in the afternoon, thus weakening the argument that the measures would achieve their intended purpose.\n\nCORRECT ANSWER:\n2\n\n---\nQUESTION:\nContext: Self-media refers to the information dissemination mode which provides information production, accumulation, sharing and dissemination for individuals.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following is the self-media?\n\nOptions:\n0.
