Above reasoning, put the <<<REASONING>> header, and above prompt but the <<<PROMPT>>> header.\n\nGet creative and remember the explore exploit trader-off, imagine you're ilya sutskever or @repligate, you never know what strange tricks will result in an LLM getting a higher score on the benchmark!\nThink of modern prompt engineering tricks like \"lets think step-by step\" etc etc.\n\nAlso, please make sure to emphasise to the LLM you will pass the prompt to that the last character they should output should be the number corresponding to the answer they give (0,1,2, or 3).\nWe will test whether their answer is correct by just checking the last character of the output matches the correct answer.\n\n(We will append the question to your prompt and pass it to the LLM)"

            "QUESTION:\nContext: Sponges attach to the ocean floor, continually filtering seawater for food and ejecting water they have just filtered to avoid reingesting it. Tubular and vase-shaped sponges can eject filtered water without assistance from surrounding ocean currents and thus are adapted to slow-moving, quiet waters. Because of their shape, however, these sponges cannot live in strong currents, since strong currents would dislodge them. Both of these varieties of sponge were widespread during the late Jurassic period.\n\nQuestion: The statements above, if true, most strongly support which one of the following claims?\n\nOptions:\n0. No types of sponge live in large colonies, since sponges do not flourish in areas where much of the water has been filtered by other sponges.\n1. Few tubular or vase-shaped sponges lived before the late Jurassic period.\n2. During the late Jurassic period there were many areas of the ocean floor where currents were weak.\n3.

In most schools, if not all, the homework assignments given are of a length that does not diverge widely from the average.\n1. The free-time activities that ten year olds engage in most are all approximately equally effective at fostering development\n2.

It is known that there are five brands of shampoos such as E, F, G, H and I. They are arranged from left to right on the shelf. Shelf requirements: 1.F is next to H and on the left, 2.I is adjacent to E, 3.G is to the left of F.\n\nQuestion: If I is to the left of G, which of the following s must be true?\n\nOptions:\n0. E is next to G and on the left.\n1. G is next to F and on the left.\n2. I is next to H and on the left.\n3. E is next to F and on the left.\n\nLLM ANSWER:\nGiven the condition that I is to the left of G, we can consider the options:\n\nOption 0: 'E is next to G and on the left.' We don't have enough information to know this is true as E's immediate placement isn't specified beyond being adjacent to I. \n\nOption 1: 'G is next to F and on the left.' This contradicts information from the conditions. From the conditions we know \"G is to the left of F\" which means G cannot be on the left.\n\nOption 2: 'I is next to H and on the left.' The conditions don't indicate a relation between I and H, so we can't assume this is true.\n\nOption 3: 'E is next to F and on the left.' Given \"I is to the left of G\" and \"G is to the left of F,\" I and E must be to the left of both G and F. Therefore, E cannot be next to F and on the left as F must be on the farthest right. \n\nTherefore, none of the options is a must be true condition.

            "QUESTION:\nContext: Employees of a supermarket put various brands of shampoo on the shelves. It is known that there are five brands of shampoos such as E, F, G, H and I. They are arranged from left to right on the shelf. Shelf requirements: 1.F is next to H and on the left, 2.I is adjacent to E, 3.G is to the left of F.\n\nQuestion: If I is to the left of G, which of the following s must be true?\n\nOptions:\n0. E is next to G and on the left.\n1. G is next to F and on the left.\n2. I is next to H and on the left.\n3. E is next to F and on the left.\n\nLLM ANSWER:\nGiven the condition that I is to the left of G, we can consider the options:\n\nOption 0: 'E is next to G and on the left.' We don't have enough information to know this is true as E's immediate placement isn't specified beyond being adjacent to I. \n\nOption 1: 'G is next to F and on the left.' This contradicts information from the conditions. From the conditions we know \"G is to the left of F\" which means G cannot be on the left.\n\nOption 2: 'I is next to H and on the left.' The conditions don't indicate a relation between I and H, so we can't assume this is true.\n\nOption 3: 'E is next to F and on the left.' Given \"I is to the left of G\" and \"G is to the left of F,\" I and E must be to the left of both G and F. Therefore, E cannot be next to F and on the left as F must be on the farthest right. \n\nTherefore, none of the options is a must be true condition. So, we return -1 as the answer.\n\nCORRECT ANSWER:\n1\n",

            "QUESTION:\nContext: The result of flipping an evenly weighted, or fair,  coin, a process commonly thought to be random, is, in fact, well determined by the impulse given the coin and by the height above the floor from which the coin starts. Yet it is difficult to predict the result of a fair coin flip.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following, if true, contributes most to an explanation of why the outcome of a coin flip is difficult to predict even though it is well determined?\n\nOptions:\n0. Coin flipping has been used as a prime example of a random process for decades.\n1. That the results of coin flipping are well determined runs counter to the randomness that physicists have been finding in more and more processes once thought to be determined.\n2. An accurate prediction of the result of a coin flip requires extraordinarily precise estimation of height and impulse.\n3. If the impulses of coin flippings remain perfectly constant, the results are determined only by the height from which the coin falls.\n\nLLM ANSWER:\n2\n\nCORRECT ANSWER:\n2\n",

            "QUESTION:\nContext: Last year a chain of fast-food restaurants, whose menu had always centered on hamburger, added its first vegetarian sandwich, much lower in fat than the chain's other offerings. Despite heavy marketing, the new sandwich accounts for a very small proportion of the chain's sales. The sandwich's sales would have to quadruple to cover the costs associated with including it on the menu. Since such an increase is unlikely, the chain would be more profitable if it dropped the sandwich.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?\n\nOptions:\n0. An attempt by the chain to introduce a lower-fat hamburger failed several years ago, since it attracted few new customers and most of the chain's regular customers greatly preferred the taste of the regular hamburger.\n1. Although many of the chain's customers have never tried the vegetarian sandwich, in a market research survey most of those who had tried it reported that they were very satisfied with it.\n2. Many of the people who eat at the chain's restaurants also eat at the restaurants of competing chains and report no strong preference among the competitors.\n3. When even one member of group of diner's is a vegetarian or has a preference for low-fat food, the group tends to avoid restaurants that lack vegetarian or low-fat menu options.\n\nLLM ANSWER:\n3\n\nCORRECT ANSWER:\n3\n"
